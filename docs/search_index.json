Each workshop will be given its own chapter in this document, where the content for the workshop will be shared. These workshops will be more interactive than presentations or lectures â€“ and each workshop will typically be accompanied by relevant R code. We plan to host one workshop per month on a Thursday 4-5pm at M3 4206. The time and date will be emailed to all statistics and actuarial science grad students in advance. If you are not a SAS grad student and would like to attend a workshop, feel free to contact one of the SWAG organizers (Augustine, Luke, Meixi, and Yiran). You can find our contact info here. Below is the list of past workshops: Sampling-resampling methods (Oct 6, 2022) The Bernstein-von Mises theorem (Oct 19, 2022) Variational inference (Nov 10, 2022) Smoothing techniques (Dec 1, 2022) Analyzing surveys with R (Jan 26, 2022) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
