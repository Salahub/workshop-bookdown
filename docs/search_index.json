Each workshop will be given its own chapter in this document, where the content for the workshop will be shared. These workshops will be more interactive than presentations or lectures â€“ and each workshop will typically be accompanied by relevant R code. For the Fall 2022 term, we have planned four workshops spanning several topics: sampling-resampling methods (Oct. 6), the Bernstein-von Mises theorem (Oct. 19), variational inference (Nov. 10), and partially identified models (Dec. 1).
