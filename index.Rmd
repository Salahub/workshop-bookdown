# Introduction

Welcome to the Github repository for the Statistical Workshops and Applications Group (SWAG)! Each workshop will be given its own chapter in this document, where the content for the workshop will be shared. These workshops will be more interactive than presentations or lectures -- and each workshop will typically be accompanied by relevant R code. For the Fall 2022 term, we have planned four workshops spanning several topics: sampling-resampling methods (Oct. 6), the Bernstein-von Mises theorem (Oct. 19), variational inference (Nov. 10), and smoothing techniques (Dec. 1).
